# miningdim-fabric
an ATM-like mining dimension mod for fabric, hopefully others too eventually
Imma have the code public so others can maintain it in my absence, though obviously you can do whatever you want within the license rules.
just please don't copy paste this into some kinda paid mod without asking first


due to the fact ore generation in layers is a nightmare to code (especially for someone's first ever usage of java), it only supports vanilla ores, but that should hopefully be enough
